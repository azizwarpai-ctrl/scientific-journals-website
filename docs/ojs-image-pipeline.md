# OJS Image Pipeline

All OJS image loading flows through two files. Do not add a third.

## Root cause (fixed)

OJS is installed at `submitmanager.com/ojs` but serves public files from the
document root: `submitmanager.com/public/…`. Old syncs wrote
`submitmanager.com/ojs/public/…` into the database, causing 500 errors.
Additionally, `submitmanager.com` blocks server-side HTTP fetches (WAF / hotlink
protection), so `next/image` with `unoptimized: true` was fetching directly
without a browser User-Agent and silently failing.

## The two canonical files

| Responsibility | File |
|---|---|
| Filename parsing + URL construction | `src/features/ojs/utils/ojs-asset-url.ts` |
| Rendering (proxied `<img>` with error fallback) | `src/features/ojs/components/ojs-image.tsx` |

### `ojs-asset-url.ts` — resolver

Three exported functions:

- **`parseOjsFilename(raw)`** — extracts the bare filename from whatever OJS
  stored. Handles three OJS storage formats:
  1. JSON: `{"en_US":{"uploadName":"cover.png"}}` or `{"uploadName":"photo.jpg"}`
  2. PHP-serialized: `a:2:{s:10:"uploadName";s:9:"photo.jpg";…}`
  3. Plain string: `cover_issue_1_en_US.png` or any string ending in an image
     extension.

- **`buildOjsPublicUrl(baseUrl, subpath, filename)`** — low-level builder for
  callers that already hold an explicit base URL (e.g. `ojs-mappers.ts`).
  Always `path.basename` + `encodeURIComponent` on the filename to prevent path
  traversal.

- **`buildOjsAssetUrl(subpath, filename)`** — high-level builder. Reads
  `OJS_BASE_URL` from the environment via `getOjsPublicAssetsBaseUrl()` (strips
  a trailing `/ojs` subpath), then calls `buildOjsPublicUrl`, then applies
  `normalizeOjsAssetUrl` as a defensive guard against any legacy `/ojs/public/`
  still in the env value.

`normalizeOjsAssetUrl(url)` in `ojs-config.ts` is the idempotent read-time fix
that rewrites any persisted `…/ojs/public/…` → `…/public/…`.

### `ojs-image.tsx` — renderer

`<OjsImage>` is a `"use client"` wrapper around a plain `<img>`. It:

1. Routes OJS hostnames (`submitmanager.com`, `journals.digitopub.com`) through
   `/api/image-proxy?url=…`, which fetches with a browser User-Agent to bypass
   the WAF.
2. Tracks load errors in local state; on error renders the `fallback` prop
   (defaults to nothing).
3. Accepts the same core props as `next/image` (`fill`, `width`, `height`,
   `sizes`, `priority`, `className`, `style`).

## Image proxy (`/api/image-proxy`)

- Validates the `url` query param against an allowlist of OJS hosts.
- Fetches with a browser User-Agent; no `Referer` header.
- Validates response `Content-Type` is `image/*`.
- Returns with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`.
- Hard limit: 1 MB response body.

## Adding a new OJS image surface

1. Parse the raw OJS setting value with `parseOjsFilename(raw)`.
2. Build the full URL with `buildOjsAssetUrl(subpath, filename)`.
   - Journal covers: `buildOjsAssetUrl("public/journals/{id}", filename)`
   - Profile images: `buildOjsAssetUrl("public/site/profileImages", filename)`
3. Render with `<OjsImage src={url} alt="…" … />`.

Do **not** use `next/image <Image>` for OJS URLs — it will fail silently
because `unoptimized: true` bypasses the server proxy.

## Hosts covered

Both `submitmanager.com` and `journals.digitopub.com` are in:
- `next.config.mjs` → `images.remotePatterns` (belt-and-suspenders)
- `OJS_HOSTS` set in `ojs-image.tsx` (proxy routing)
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` set in `app/api/image-proxy/route.ts` (security allowlist)

## Tests

`tests/unit/ojs-asset-url.test.ts` covers all three storage formats, the
`/ojs/public/` rewrite, path-traversal safety, null/garbage inputs, and the
env-var stripping logic.
